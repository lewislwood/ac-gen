Walkthroug to creating a Repository that will house your own Audio Catalog. You will need to have a GitHub account and be logged in. The basic address ig <a href="http://github.com/new">GitHub.com/new</a>. Only requirement is that it must be public, unless you have a professional account. Fill descript and include a readme if descired. Repository will display the readme file for the repository if present. Otherwise, description wil be sued. This has no impact on your Audio catalog for repos readme.
