When you finally have the Audio Catalog Generated and placed in the local version of the repository. It is now to enable GitHub Pages. Now if you are uploading files to your repository via some other means, then all you need do is enable the GitHub Pages. You could skip the 1st 2 minutes where I push the audio catalog up to the repository on GitHub.
