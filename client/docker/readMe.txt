These are the docker files to spin up a server if desired.  

I designed the project to run in a simple file browsing environment, thus no http server requried.  This simplifies the design for anyone to implement.

These files are provided only as my original design which had limations and was too complicated.
Spin up the server by doing the fowllowing.
copy the docker files to the parent folder (client).  This will be the root folder.
2.  Type: docker compose up -d
simply open browser to http://localhost:8080/index.html
Once down bring down the server to save memory.

Docker compose down.
