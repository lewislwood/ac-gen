Walkthrough on generating the HTML for the Audio Catalog. You will be able to preview it before you commit this catalog. Safty would not want you to accidentally replace a good audio catalog.
Then I demonstrate copying the public folder into myvsCode Repository and rename the folder to docs off the root folder of the repository. You could just copy this folder anywhere and be done, but if you are suing GitHub and Git system, you want these extera instructions. ("Git add .", "Git status", "git commit -m"commit message"", "git push").
